This is Ryan!  I'm a recent graduate from Cornell Tech documenting my journey in machine learning.  My interests include computational physics, robotics, cyber-security, reinforcement learning, and entrepreneurship.  This site is a little bit of that and a little bit of this.

When I'm not coding or reading tech blogs I love exploring the outdoors, martial arts, chess, and photography. One of my favorite outdoor memories is fishing in the Gulf of Alaska.  I always love meeting new people and learning new things. Please feel free to visit my [github](http://github.com/RyanGale-AK) to see some of my latest coding projects. Let's chat!
